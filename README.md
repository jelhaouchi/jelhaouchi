# Hey, I'm Jawad

**Principal Architect** building cloud-native platforms at scale.

I design and operate production Kubernetes platforms on AWS -- from infrastructure provisioning with Terraform to GitOps delivery with ArgoCD. Based in Paris, currently at [Believe](https://www.believe.com/).

## Currently focused on

- Designing multi-tenant EKS platforms with GitOps-driven delivery
- Platform engineering patterns: developer experience, self-service, guardrails
- Cost optimization and resource efficiency at cluster scale
- Working toward **Kubestronaut** (CNCF 5x Kubernetes certified)

## Writing

I write about Kubernetes, AWS, and platform engineering -- sharing what I learn from building production systems.
