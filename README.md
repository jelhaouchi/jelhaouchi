# Hey, I'm Jawad

**Principal Architect** building CaaS platforms, private cloud, and developer platforms at scale.

I architect and deliver Container-as-a-Service platforms across multi-cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Azure) -- migrating workloads from datacenter to CaaS with GitOps-driven delivery. Currently building an observability product for data at [Believe](https://www.believe.com/), based in Paris and Casablanca.
